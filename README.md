🎬 **Senior Backend Engineer Mode Activated**
Welcome to **Day 1: Foundation & Animation Studio Bridge**.
We’re going to build this **exactly** like a senior engineer would—slow, explicit, and with reasoning behind *every* decision.

You’re not just “setting up a server.”
You’re laying the **structural foundation of a real animation studio backend** that could scale to **1000+ artists, millions of assets, and render farms**.

# — FOUNDATION

## “Why Animation Studios Need Backend Systems”

Before code, we anchor *why this exists*.

### 🎥 Why animation studios are backend-heavy

Animation studios are **not CRUD apps**. They are:

* Asset factories (huge files, versioning, dependencies)
* Workflow engines (pipeline stages, approvals, renders)
* Collaboration platforms (many artists, same assets)
* Infrastructure systems (queues, background jobs, compute)

Frontend (React) = **interaction layer**
Backend = **source of truth + orchestration brain**

> 💡 Think of the backend as the *production coordinator* of the studio.

# WHAT WE BUILD TODAY (DAY 1 SCOPE)

By the end of Day 1, you will have:

✅ Production-grade Express + TypeScript backend
✅ Enterprise folder structure (service / controller / repo)
✅ Security middleware (helmet, rate limiting, env validation)
✅ Health check endpoints (ops-ready)
✅ Docker + docker-compose
✅ Testing infrastructure (Jest + Supertest)
✅ Git workflow (how seniors commit foundations)

This is **Level 0 infrastructure** everything else depends on.
